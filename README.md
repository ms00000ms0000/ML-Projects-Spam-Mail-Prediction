# ML-Projects-Spam-Mail-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** is a **Spam Mail Prediction System** developed using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The dataset consists of two columns — **Category (Spam/Ham)** and **Message**. Text data was transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for effective feature extraction. The model was trained to classify emails as spam or legitimate based on message content and achieved an impressive **accuracy of 96%**. This project showcases the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for **text classification** and highlights how ML can enhance **email filtering systems**, improving security and reducing unwanted messages in digital communication.
